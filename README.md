# Number Generator

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
```The project I uploaded is a number generator.

You have to guess a certain number between 1 and 100 in the least amount of tries.  

When you guess a number it will let you know whether the randomly generated number is higher or lower then your 
the number you chose.  

When you guess it correctly, the program will let you know how many times it took for you to guess that number.```
